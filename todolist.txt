create nodes

create graph and connect nodes edge being distance between them

connect each node with each other node keeping a certain distance radius as threshold or unless you get a certain node in certain degree atleast one node should be there in 0 to 180

now calculate the starving areas in the graph with the node.value if less than certain starving threshold always keep record of a certain radius so that it can pre compute maximum starving area to later on form a circle around the area to form a maximum radius which is considered to be red zone

now after creating a circle around the starving zone

find out the nearest high production area

then start flowing food supplies form the outer radius to inner radius and 
initialize circular mechanism.
As the supplies will continuously flow we can concentrate a flow in a red zone more

As the nearest highest production is donating higher amount it needs to be balanced by another highest production near it and the supply chain goes on.
